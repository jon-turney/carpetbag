This is based on using a Fedora 23 host, and Windows Server 2012R2 x64 guest

R9N79-23MWD-MBP9B-KHF8Q-C36WX

Note that in the default Fedora 23 partitioning, /var/lib/libvirt is on /, which is only 50MB.
It's easy to fill this up with VM images...

* install virt-manager etc.

dnf install virt-manager

* add yourself to the libvirt group (to avoid authentication prompts and allow use over ssh)

usermod -a -G libvirt <your-username>

* install virtio-win
(as per https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Windows_Virtio_Drivers)

wget https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/virtio-win.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/virtio-win.repo
dnf install virtio-win
optional: dnf --enablerepo=virtio-win-latest upgrade virtio-win

* create VM

optional: use virtio disk and NIC drivers
(as per http://serverfault.com/questions/703675/install-windows-2012-r2-over-kvm-virtualizaton)

* add QEMU guest agent channel device to the Virtual Machine hardware
(as per https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Virtualization_Deployment_and_Administration_Guide/chap-QEMU_Guest_Agent.html
 section 11.1.2, step 3)

* install Windows Server 2012R2 x64 into VM

* install virtio-serial device driver into VM

* install virtio guest agent into VM
(as per ditto, section 11.1.2, step 4)

We need qemu-agent to be at least version 2.5.  Currently the version in the
virtio-win package is too old.

Get the qemu-ga-x86_64.msi I have built into the VM somehow and install it, e.g.

mkisofs -J -r -o qemu-ga.iso /path/containing/msi/files/
mv qemu-ga.iso /var/lib/libvirt/images/
virsh attach-disk win2k12r2  /var/lib/libvirt/images/ hdb
Double click on the qemu-ga-x64.msi installer
Detach iso

* verify that QEMU Guest Agent service is running in the VM

* verify that guest agent can be contacted and supports guest-exec

virsh qemu-agent-command win2k12r2 '{"execute":"guest-info"}' | grep guest-exec

* install cygwin into VM

base + cygport

* cleanly shutdown the VM

XXX: apply updates?
XXX: sysprep?

* make it's disk image read-only

chmod -w /var/lib/libvirt/images/win2k12r2.qcow

*  Install carpetbag onto host

git clone somewhere
dnf install python3-dirq libvirt-python3
sudo mkdir /var/lib/carpetbag
sudo chmod a+w /var/lib/carpetbag

* (optional: install memory balloon)

install driver
(as admin) blsnvr -i to install service

* The only network access the VM needs is to a samba share containing cygwin setup and mirror.

This could be on the host, or another VM on an isolated virtual network...
